Part 2 Lab exercises


1. Starting the VM went fine. I used apt-get to install the VMWare package, ran into a couple problems I had to google around for, but installation and starting the VM went fine.

2. I skipped this step because I typically do user accounts as a matter of security, and no one is connecting to my VM without getting into my local machine first.

3. This went fine, although I admit that I used the C++ program I wrote for Sherry's class yesterday. I sftp'd it onto Ada from my local machine, and then pulled it off with the VM, compiled it, and it ran fine.

4. It was pretty easy to get an SSH connection going from my VM to my local machine; I just installed openssh-server on my local machine and ssh'd to my computer's IP on the Evergreen network. I spent some time trying to get it to work going the other directions with some instructions here: http://www.eldemonionegro.com/blog/archivos/2008/05/18/howto-access-a-virtualbox-guest-machine-throught-ssh-or-how-to-port-forwarding, but didn't get it working. I may come back to this ,but right now given that sftp is fine with put and get, being able to connect one way is more than enough.
